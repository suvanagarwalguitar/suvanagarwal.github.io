    <h1>Suvan Agarwal's Biography</h1>
    <p>Last updated on January 30, 2024</p>
    <p>Suvan Agarwal is a young American guitarist with international experience. He has won numerous prizes at the Louisville Guitar Competition, Guitar Foundation of America International Ensemble Competition, and Tuesday Musical competition, where in addition to first prize in the guitar category, he won the audience prize in the final round open to winners from all instrument categories. He has performed in both the United States and Japan.
    <br>
    <br>
    Suvan started playing guitar at the age of five taught by Frank Longay, creator of the Suzuki guitar method. After Frank's passing, he studied guitar under the guidance of Alexandra Viloteau (née Iranfar), and at the end of high school made the decision to enter Oberlin College and Conservatory's double degree program to study physics and guitar performance. Suvan now studies with Stephen Aron and will graduate with degrees in guitar performance and physics in Spring 2024. He has participated in masterclasses with David Russell, Leo Brouwer, and Raphaella Smits, among many others. He has also taken lessons with Gentaro Takada and Thomas Viloteau. Suvan will enter the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland starting in Fall 2024, where he will study under Matthew McAllister and Allan Neave. He is the recipient of a full ride post-graduate scholarship awarded by the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music (ABRSM).
  <br>
  <br>
  In addition to his musical activities, Suvan was also a recipient of a National Science Foundation scholarship to conduct geophysics research at the University of Hawaii in 2022, as well as a scholarship from the Friends of the University of Tokyo (FUTI) foundation to conduct geophysics research at the UTokyo Earthquake Research Institute (東京大学地震研究所) in 2023. He studied abroad at Waseda University（早稲田大学）in 2022, and was the first Oberlin College student ever to receive the Bridging Scholarship from the United States-Japan Bridging Foundation. Suvan was born in Japan and speaks both English and Japanese. His mother is Japanese-American and his father is Indian. He grew up in Sunnyvale, California.</p>
