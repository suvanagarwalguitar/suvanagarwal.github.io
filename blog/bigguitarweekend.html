          <p>At the beginning of November, The Royal Conservatoire of Scotland hosts the biggest guitar event of the year, aptly named Big Guitar Weekend. There are concerts, masterclasses, and a small school-wide competition for â‚¬200 worth of strings from Knobloch Strings. This time, I was fortunate to be able to participate in a masterclass featuring <a href="https://www.esm.rochester.edu/directory/odette-paul/">Paul O'Dette</a>, one of if not the most influential lutenists and baroque practitioners alive. I played for him the Prelude and Gigue from Bach's first keyboard partita, and it was nothing short of a stellar masterclass. Even though it was only thirty minutes, he dropped enough advice to keep me busy for a few weeks. Particularly noteworthy tidbits of information included:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>You can get different tones from a pull-off on your left hand.</li>
            <li>Think of the upper and lower voices of the Gigue as in dialogue, and keep the articulations <em>tight.</em></li>
            <li>In the repeated note/trill ostinato that gives the Prelude its character, articulate the first note to keep it from sounding mushy.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>In another nice turn of events, I won the Knobloch Strings prize! Regretfully, I have not yet found a picture from any of the concerts or the competition. However, here is a picture of the prize, which I recently received in the mail. I previously used D'Addario strings, but have recently switched to Knobloch, as I find their high tension carbon strings to produce a sweeter sound while keeping the punch that carbon strings are known for.</p>
