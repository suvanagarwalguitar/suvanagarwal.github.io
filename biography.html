  <br>
  Suvan started playing guitar at the age of five taught by Frank Longay, creator of the Suzuki guitar method. After Frank's untimely passing in 2011, he took a break from guitar due to lack of interest, eventually returning to lessons in high school with a renewed love of music. Under the guidance of Alexandra Viloteau (née Iranfar), he rapidly improved, and during his senior year he made the decision to enter Oberlin College and Conservatory's double degree program to study physics and guitar performance. Suvan now studies with Stephen Aron and is due to graduate with degrees in guitar performance and physics in Spring 2024. He will begin pursuing a masters degree at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland starting in Fall 2024 after receiving a full ride scholarship from the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music (ABRSM). He will study under Matthew McAllister and Allan Neave.

He studied abroad at Waseda University（早稲田大学）in 2022, and was the first Oberlin College student ever to receive the Bridging Scholarship from the United States-Japan Bridging Foundation. Suvan was born in Japan and speaks both English and Japanese. He is part Indian and part Japanese.</p>
